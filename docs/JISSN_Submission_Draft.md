Caffeine in Esports Players

---

## Abstract

**Background:**
Caffeine consumption is prevalent in electronic sports (esports) to optimize cognitive performance. This cross-sectional study investigated caffeine consumption patterns, their associations with gaming level, motivations, and adverse effects in 181 Brazilian esports players.

**Methods:**
Participants (mean age = 25.70 ± 6.64 years; 75.14% male) completed an online questionnaire. Average daily caffeine intake was 276.37 ± 218.69 mg.

**Results:**
Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a difference in caffeine consumption among Amateurs/Casuals, Semi-Professionals, and Professionals (H = 8.11, p = 0.0173). Direct comparison between Amateurs/Casuals (281.40 mg) and Semi-Professionals (210.66 mg) showed no significant difference (U = 2647.50, p = 0.1383, r = 0.1115). Consumption was significantly higher among those seeking to improve performance (p = 0.0003). Higher caffeine doses were associated with insomnia (p = 0.0152) and stomach pain (p = 0.0092). No significant correlation was found between caffeine and gaming hours (ρ = 0.0460, p = 0.5456).

**Conclusions:**
The findings indicate high caffeine consumption, with distinct usage patterns by experience level and motivation, and clear associations with specific adverse effects. This underscores the urgent need for guidelines for safe and effective consumption to maximize benefits and minimize health risks in this population.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Esports and Caffeine Consumption: Context and Rationale
Electronic sports (esports) have experienced exponential growth in the last decade, consolidating as a multibillion-dollar global industry that attracts millions of engaged spectators and players. In 2023, the global esports market was valued at approximately USD 1.72 billion, with projections indicating growth to USD 6.75 billion by 2030 [@ref7]. Brazil follows this trend, being one of the largest markets in Latin America, with an audience exceeding 40 million people in 2023 [@ref10]. In this scenario of high competitiveness and demand for sustained cognitive performance, caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant, is frequently used by players seeking to optimize alertness, concentration, reaction time, and mental endurance during prolonged training sessions and competitions [@ref8; @ref9]. Consumption occurs through various sources, such as coffee, teas, energy drinks, soft drinks, and specific supplements, raising questions about usage patterns and potential impacts on the health and performance of this specific population.

## 1.2. Relevant Literature Review
Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is one of the most studied and consumed ergogenic aids worldwide. Its main mechanisms of action include antagonism of adenosine receptors in the brain, mobilization of intracellular calcium, and inhibition of phosphodiesterases, resulting in increased excitatory neurotransmission, reduced perception of fatigue, and improved neuromuscular function [@ref3]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that moderate doses of caffeine (typically 3-6 mg/kg of body weight) can significantly improve both physical performance (e.g., endurance, strength) and various cognitive functions crucial for athletes, such as attention, vigilance, reaction time, and mood [@ref4; @ref5].

Although much of the research has focused on traditional athletes, the cognitive benefits, especially in maintaining attention and reducing the perception of effort, are highly transferable to the demands of esports players. Recent studies have corroborated this transfer: Wu et al. (2024) demonstrated that supplementation with 3 mg/kg of caffeine significantly improved cognitive abilities (Stroop task, visual search) and performance in shooting games (kill rate, accuracy) in elite players. Similarly, Rogers et al. (2024) found that doses of 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg of caffeine improved shooting performance and reaction time in FPS players, with no significant differences between doses, suggesting that even smaller doses can be ergogenic. Despite this, effects on other cognitive functions, such as working memory and complex executive functions, may be less consistent when caffeine is consumed alone or depending on the dose and individual sensitivity [@ref6]. There is still a need to characterize caffeine consumption patterns and their perceived effects in broader and more diverse samples of esports players, particularly in Brazil, considering the variety of sources and contexts of use.

## 1.3. Identified Gaps in Knowledge
Despite evidence on the benefits and risks of caffeine in different populations, there is a lack of systematic studies describing caffeine consumption patterns in esports and analyzing relationships with gaming experience, health habits, and the occurrence of adverse effects. Furthermore, few studies address multiple sources of caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, supplements, tea, and chocolate) in an integrated manner.

## 1.4. Study Objectives and Hypotheses
This study aimed to characterize caffeine consumption patterns in Brazilian esports players and investigate associations with demographic variables, experience level, and well-being indicators. The hypotheses investigated were:
1.  **H1:** There are differences in daily caffeine consumption among players of different competition levels (Amateur/Casual, Semi-Professional, Professional).
2.  **H2:** Higher caffeine consumption is associated with a longer average daily gaming time.
3.  **H3:** Caffeine consumption is associated with a higher occurrence of specific adverse effects, namely insomnia and stomach pain. (Tachycardia and tremors were also investigated).
4.  **H4:** Players who consume caffeine intending to improve gaming performance have a higher average daily caffeine intake.
5.  **H5:** The primary gaming platform (PC, console, mobile) is associated with the occurrence of specific adverse effects of caffeine.
6.  **H6:** There are differences in daily caffeine consumption between male and female participants.

# 2. Materials and Methods

## 2.1. Study Design: Cross-sectional survey
This study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design, in which a structured online questionnaire was made available to Brazilian esports players. The instrument consisted of sections on sociodemographic data, gaming habits, sources and frequency of caffeine consumption, use of energy drinks and supplements, as well as the occurrence of adverse effects. Data collection took place over a four-week period, with dissemination on social media and specialized esports forums.

## 2.2. Participants: Inclusion criteria and consent screening
- Of the 303 participants who started the online questionnaire, 122 were excluded for not completing the questionnaire or not signing the consent form, resulting in a final sample of 181 participants.
Eligible participants were those aged 18 years or older, who identified as esports players and provided free and informed consent at the beginning of the questionnaire. The consent filter was applied during the data processing stage, ensuring the exclusion of responses without consent and guaranteeing participant anonymity.

## 2.3. Instrument: Brief description of the questionnaire
The online questionnaire, consisting of 64 questions, was made available asynchronously on the Respondi.app platform and organized into sections covering sociodemographic data, gaming habits, sources and frequency of caffeine consumption (coffee, supplements, energy drinks, tea, and chocolate), and the occurrence of adverse effects. The full questionnaire is available in Appendix A and in `docs/RelatorioFinal_Éllis.md`.

## 2.4. Data Processing: Cleaning, coding, and exploratory analysis
The raw data, collected from the online questionnaire, were imported into a Python environment for processing. This process included removing personally identifiable information (PII), standardizing date and text formats, and converting textual responses and non-standardized values (e.g., '#ERROR!', empty strings) into missing values for numerical columns. Conditional columns had their values explicitly defined as missing values when the preceding condition was not met (e.g., details about coffee consumption for non-consumers). Some variables had missing data, such as 'Participant Age (years)' (1.66% missing data, N=3) and 'Average Hours of Main Game per Day' (3.31% missing data, N=6); other columns with a high percentage of missing data were mostly conditional (e.g., supplementation details for non-users) or were not used in the main analyses reported here. Systematic outlier removal was not performed; instead, robust statistical methods were used. For identifying outliers in scatter plots, the interquartile range (IQR) criterion was used: points below Q1 − 1.5×IQR or above Q3 + 1.5×IQR were considered outliers. For visualization purposes, these outliers were omitted from scatter diagrams, but all statistical correlation analyses were conducted on the complete dataset, including outliers, to ensure robustness. In boxplots, outliers are displayed as individual points beyond the whisker limits, as per the standard IQR definition. Subsequently, a detailed codebook was generated (see Appendix B), and an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify patterns and distributions. The final dataset used for statistical analyses contained the processed and coded variables.

### 2.4.1. Quantification of Caffeine Consumption
Total daily caffeine consumption for each participant was recalculated post-hoc to ensure greater accuracy and consistency, using a dedicated computational procedure. This procedure processed questionnaire responses regarding the consumption of different caffeine-containing items, including coffee, teas, energy drinks, cola-type soft drinks, chocolates, and supplements (caffeine pills and pre-workouts).

For each item, the methodology considered:
1.  **Frequency of Consumption:** Responses about weekly consumption frequency (e.g., "3-4 times a week") and, where applicable, the number of times per day, were converted into an average daily multiplier.
2.  **Product Type and Volume:** Responses about the specific product type (e.g., "Espresso coffee," "Black tea," "Monster Energy Drink," "Dark chocolate") and the volume of the consumed portion (e.g., "Small cup: 50 ml," "473ml can") were used to select the appropriate caffeine content from a consolidated reference table and to adjust caffeine proportionally to the volume.
3.  **Caffeine Reference Table:** A detailed reference table of caffeine content in various products was compiled based on information from the original study (mentioned in Appendix A) and supplemented with data from nutritional sources and manufacturers. This table specifies the average caffeine content (in mg) per standard serving (e.g., per 100ml for beverages, per 30g for solid chocolates, per unit for pills). Auxiliary functions were implemented to interpret textually described volumes (e.g., "Large cup") and chocolate portions (e.g., "2 squares").
4.  **Daily Dose Calculation:** For each consumed item, the caffeine dose was calculated by multiplying the caffeine content of the portion (adjusted by volume, if applicable) by the daily frequency multiplier. The sum of caffeine doses from all items resulted in the recalculated total daily caffeine consumption for each participant. Weekly consumption was derived by multiplying the daily value by seven.
5.  **Special Cases:** For supplements, if the participant specified the caffeine dose in mg (e.g., "400mg"), this value was used directly, overriding the default value from the reference table. For herbal teas, caffeine content was considered zero. In the case of multiple types of the same item (e.g., different types of coffee or chocolate), the logic considered the main response and, in some cases of concomitant consumption, added contributions from secondary types.

The recalculated values of daily and weekly caffeine consumption, named 'Recalculated Total Daily Caffeine Consumption (mg)' and 'Recalculated Total Weekly Caffeine Consumption (mg),' were integrated into the final dataset, allowing comparisons with the original calculations and serving as the basis for the analyses reported in this study that use the caffeine consumption variable.

## 2.5. Statistical Analyses: Tests and software used
Statistical analyses were conducted using Python with the `pandas` library for data manipulation, `scipy.stats` for main statistical tests, and `scikit-posthocs` for specific post-hoc tests (such as Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction).
To compare Total Daily Caffeine Consumption (mg) (a non-normally distributed continuous variable) between two independent groups (e.g., Occurrence of Insomnia Yes/No, Caffeine Consumption with Intention to Improve Performance Yes/No [H4], Participant Gender [H6]), the Mann-Whitney U test was used. The test's directionality (one-tailed or two-tailed) was chosen based on the nature of the specific hypothesis. To compare among the three groups of Player Experience Level (Amateur/Casual, Semi-Professional, Professional [H1]), the Kruskal-Wallis test was used, followed by Dunn's post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction.
The association between caffeine consumption and gaming hours (Average Hours of Main Game per Day [H2]), both non-normally distributed continuous/ordinal variables, was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation (ρ).
To investigate the association between categorical variables (Main Gaming Platform vs. occurrence of specific adverse effects [H5]), contingency tables and Fisher's Exact Test were used, appropriate for samples with low expected counts in some cells.
The significance level adopted for all analyses was α = 0.05. The choice of non-parametric tests was justified by the EDA results, which indicated skewed distributions and the presence of outliers in the Total Daily Caffeine Consumption (mg) variable.

Additionally, a power analysis was conducted for the H1 comparison, using Cohen's d approximation from the effect size r (d = 2r/√(1−r²)), resulting in d = 0.2244 and power = 0.2039 to detect differences between Amateurs/Casuals and Semi-Professionals (α = 0.05). A multiple linear regression model was also implemented on the log-transformed daily caffeine consumption, including average gaming hours, intention to improve performance, dummies for Semi-Professional and Professional levels, and a dummy for female gender as predictors. The model showed an adjusted R² = 0.102 (R² = 0.129), with significant effects for intention to improve performance (β = 1.151, p = 0.001), Semi-Professional level (β = -0.721, p = 0.049), and a marginal effect for Professional level (β = 1.732, p = 0.053).

## 2.6. Ethical Considerations
This study followed the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Campinas (CAAE: 53895021.6.0000.5404). Informed consent was obtained digitally before the start of the questionnaire, and all data were treated anonymously.

# 3. Results

## 3.1. Sample Description
The study sample consisted of 181 Brazilian esports players who provided consent and completed the online questionnaire.
- Of the 303 individuals who initiated the questionnaire, 122 were excluded (due to incompleteness or lack of consent).
The average age of the participants was 25.70 years (Standard Deviation, SD = 6.64; Minimum = 18, Maximum = 56), with 1.66% missing data for this variable (N=3). Most participants identified as male (75.14%, N=136), while 20.44% (N=37) identified as female, and 4.42% (N=8) indicated other gender identities or preferred not to answer. Regarding self-reported esports experience level, the sample was predominantly composed of Amateur/Casual players (80.66%, N=146), followed by Semi-Professionals (17.13%, N=31), and a small portion of Professionals (2.21%, N=4).

## 3.2. Descriptive Analysis of Main Variables
The average total daily caffeine consumption (Total Daily Caffeine Consumption (mg)) reported by participants was 276.37 mg (SD = 218.69 mg; Median = 228.74 mg), ranging from 0 mg to a maximum of 1092.91 mg, with no missing values for this variable. Regarding caffeine sources, 76.24% (N=138) of participants reported consuming coffee, and 56.35% (N=102) reported consuming energy drinks. The average hours dedicated to the main game per day (Average Hours of Main Game per Day) was 2.48 hours (SD = 1.70 hours; Median = 3.00 hours), with 3.31% missing data (N=6) for this variable.

## 3.3. Main Statistical Findings
**H1: Caffeine Consumption vs. Player Level**
- Hypothesis H1, which predicted higher consumption at higher competition levels, showed a nuanced result. The Kruskal-Wallis test indicated an overall statistically significant difference (p=0.0173) in caffeine consumption among Amateurs/Casuals, Semi-Professionals, and Professionals. However, Dunn's post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction did not identify significant differences between specific group pairs (Amateur/Casual vs. Semi-Professional: p=0.0711; Amateur/Casual vs. Professional: p=0.5152; Semi-Professional vs. Professional: p=0.0957). This apparent contradiction may be partly due to the very small size of the Professional group (N=4), which, despite having the highest average consumption (602.09 mg), did not allow post-hoc comparisons to reach statistical significance. However, in the direct comparison between Amateurs/Casuals (N = 146; Mean = 281.40 mg) and Semi-Professionals (N = 31; Mean = 210.66 mg) via Mann-Whitney U test (U = 2647.50, p = 0.1383, r = 0.1115), no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups.

**H2: Caffeine Consumption vs. Gaming Hours**
No statistically significant correlation was found between daily caffeine consumption (Total Daily Caffeine Consumption (mg)) and average main gaming hours per day (Average Hours of Main Game per Day) (Spearman's correlation ρ = 0.0460, p = 0.5456, N = 175).

**H3: Specific Adverse Effects vs. Caffeine Dose**
The association between caffeine consumption and the occurrence of specific adverse effects was investigated:
*   **Insomnia:** Participants who reported insomnia (N=94) had significantly higher caffeine consumption (Mean = 300.54 ± 212.74 mg) compared to those without insomnia (N=87; Mean = 250.26 ± 223.23 mg) (Mann-Whitney U test = 4852.00, p = 0.0152, one-tailed).
*   **Stomach Pain:** Similarly, participants with stomach pain (N=71) reported significantly higher caffeine consumption (Mean = 314.47 ± 212.25 mg) than those without this symptom (N=105; Mean = 253.30 ± 222.44 mg) (Mann-Whitney U test = 4509.50, p = 0.0092, one-tailed).
*   **Other Effects:** For tachycardia (p = 0.2209), tremors (p = 0.0911), and nervousness (insufficient data for analysis), no statistically significant differences in caffeine consumption were found between groups with and without the effect.

**H4: Caffeine Consumption vs. Intention to Improve Performance**
Players who reported consuming caffeine with the intention to improve gaming performance (N=31) had significantly higher average daily caffeine consumption (Mean = 417.72 ± 271.56 mg) compared to those who did not have this primary intention (N=144; Mean = 248.49 ± 197.64 mg) (Mann-Whitney U test = 3122.50, p = 0.0003, one-tailed).

**H5: Main Platform vs. Specific Adverse Effects**
No statistically significant associations were found between the main gaming platform (Mobile, PC, Playstation, Xbox) and the occurrence of insomnia (Fisher's Exact Test, p = 0.9823), tachycardia (p = 0.5671), tremors (p = 0.7998), or stomach pain (p = 0.2554).

**H6: Caffeine Consumption vs. Gender**
No statistically significant difference was found in daily caffeine consumption between male (N = 136; Mean = 280.10 ± 220.50 mg) and female participants (N = 37; Mean = 260.20 ± 200.30 mg) (Mann-Whitney U test = 2412.00, p = 0.7016, r = -0.0293, two-tailed), excluding the "Other/Prefer Not to Say" group (N = 8) due to its small size.

**Additional Analyses: Correlations with Age**
*   **Age vs. Total Daily Caffeine Consumption (mg):** No statistically significant correlation was found between participant age and their total daily caffeine consumption (Spearman's correlation ρ = -0.0332, p = 0.6596, N = 178). See Figure 4.
*   **Age vs. Average Hours of Main Game per Day:** A weak but statistically significant negative correlation was observed between participant age and average main gaming hours per day (Spearman's correlation ρ = -0.2008, p = 0.0081, N = 175). See Figure 5.

# 4. Discussion

## 4.1. Interpretation of Findings
The results of this study indicate that, in the analyzed sample of Brazilian esports players, the average daily caffeine consumption (276.37 ± 218.69 mg) is considerable. The analysis of consumption by competition level (H1) showed an overall difference (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.0173), but post-hoc comparisons did not reveal significant differences between group pairs, possibly due to the small N of the Professional group, which had the highest average consumption (602.09 mg). The direct comparison between Amateurs/Casuals and Semi-Professionals was also not significant.

The absence of a correlation between caffeine and gaming hours (H2, ρ = 0.0460) suggests that game duration alone does not dictate caffeine consumption in this sample, which may be influenced by other factors such as perceived intensity or individual habits [@ref3].

The associations between higher caffeine consumption and the occurrence of insomnia (H3, p=0.0152) and stomach pain (H3, p=0.0092) are consistent with the known side effects of the substance [@ref3], reinforcing the need for moderation. Other investigated adverse effects did not show a significant association.

It was confirmed that players who consume caffeine to improve performance (H4) ingest significantly higher doses, aligning with the perception of caffeine as an ergogenic aid in esports [@ref8; @ref9]. The gaming platform (H5) was not associated with adverse effects, and there was no significant difference in caffeine consumption between male and female genders (H6).

Additional analyses with the age variable revealed no correlation between age and caffeine consumption. However, a weak but significant negative correlation was observed between age and gaming hours, indicating that older players tend to play fewer hours per day. This latter observation may reflect changing priorities, increased responsibilities (professional, family), or different patterns of engagement with games as age advances in this specific sample.

## 4.2. Comparison with Existing Literature
The findings of this study partially align with existing literature and also present unique aspects. The high prevalence of caffeine consumption (87.29%) is consistent with studies in other populations of players and athletes [@ref11], although the average dose may vary. The result that Amateurs/Casuals consume more caffeine than Semi-Professionals (H1) contrasts with initial expectations but may reflect different approaches to substance use. While professionals and semi-professionals might have a more calculated and strategic use, aiming to optimize performance with minimal effective doses [@ref9], casual players may consume more recreationally or with less information about dosage thresholds and adverse effects.

## 4.3. Theoretical and Practical Implications
The findings of this study contribute to the growing literature on the use of substances for performance optimization in the esports context. Theoretically, the higher caffeine consumption by Amateur/Casual players compared to Semi-Professionals, coupled with recent literature demonstrating the efficacy of lower doses [@ref8; @ref9], suggests that the relationship between caffeine dose, skill level, and perceived/actual performance may not be linear and warrants further investigation. There might be an "optimal point" of consumption that higher-level players are more likely to identify or respect, while casual players might follow a "more is better" pattern without necessarily obtaining proportional benefits.

From a practical standpoint, the results highlight the need for education and the development of guidelines on caffeine consumption for esports players of all levels. These guidelines should emphasize:
1.  **Effective and safe doses:** Informing about doses shown to improve cognitive and motor performance specific to esports (e.g., 1-3 mg/kg), discouraging excessive consumption.
2.  **Caffeine sources:** Alerting about the variable caffeine content in different products (coffee, energy drinks, supplements) and the risks associated with other ingredients in energy drinks.
3.  **Timing of consumption:** Suggesting timing strategies to optimize caffeine effects for training and competitions, minimizing impact on sleep.
4.  **Individual sensitivity and adverse effects:** Educating about variability in response to caffeine and potential side effects (anxiety, insomnia, gastrointestinal discomfort), encouraging self-awareness and moderation.
5.  **Hydration and general nutrition:** Contextualizing caffeine use within a holistic approach to health and performance, including adequate hydration and a balanced diet.

## 4.4. Study Limitations
This study has limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Firstly, the cross-sectional design allows for the identification of associations but not causal relationships. Secondly, the reliance on self-reporting to quantify caffeine consumption and gaming habits may introduce memory or social desirability bias. The quantification of caffeine consumption, although detailed, may not perfectly capture the bioavailability from different sources. Thirdly, the sample was a convenience sample recruited online, which may limit the generalizability of the results to the entire population of Brazilian esports players; players more engaged in online communities might be overrepresented. Fourthly, the small number of participants in the 'Professional' group prevented robust comparative analyses with this elite level. Finally, although we analyzed specific adverse symptoms like insomnia and stomach pain, the way data on other adverse effects were collected (e.g., general frequency for some) or the low occurrence of other specific symptoms may have limited a more exhaustive analysis of a broader spectrum of effects and their individual relationship with caffeine dosage.

## 4.5. Suggestions for Future Research
Future investigations could benefit from a longitudinal design to track changes in consumption patterns and their effects over time. The inclusion of objective measures of performance in specific games, along with detailed consumption diaries and analyses of individual caffeine sensitivity (e.g., genotyping for polymorphisms in the CYP1A2 gene), could better elucidate the complex relationship between caffeine, performance, and well-being in esports players. Qualitative studies could also explore players' perceptions, motivations, and experiences with caffeine in more depth. Additionally, further exploring the nuances of caffeine consumption between genders, such as preferred product types, specific motivations for use, and perception of adverse effects, would be valuable, possibly with larger samples to detect subtle differences. Given the prevalence of use, it is crucial to investigate education and awareness strategies regarding responsible caffeine use in this population.

# 5. Conclusion

This exploratory study on caffeine consumption among Brazilian esports players revealed significant and complex usage patterns. Contrary to initial expectations, amateur/casual players reported higher caffeine consumption than semi-professionals, suggesting that the level of professionalization may influence the strategy for using this substance. The most clinically relevant finding was the direct association between higher caffeine doses and the occurrence of insomnia (H3a) and stomach pain (H3b), highlighting important implications for players' health and well-being. Although the pursuit of performance improvement was a motivating factor for consumption, as expected, other investigated relationships—such as the association of caffeine consumption with Average Main Game Hours per Day (H2), main gaming platform (H5), or gender (H6), were not significant, indicating the need to explore other mediating and moderating factors.

The results underscore the importance of understanding psychoactive substance consumption habits in specific populations like esports players, who seek to optimize performance in a competitive and cognitively demanding environment. The findings contribute to an initial overview of the Brazilian scenario, pointing to the need for further research, especially with larger and more diverse samples of professional players, and for the development of guidelines on the conscious use of caffeine, aiming to maximize potential benefits while minimizing health risks. The prevalence of consumption and associations with adverse effects warrant attention from health professionals, coaches, and players themselves for more informed caffeine management in the esports context.
